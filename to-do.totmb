Lexer is not ready.
How to understand lexeme type if there is something same in the begining?
Ideas:
	- make substrings from main string
		* But how to undestand what the separator is?
		| Maybe just add supported letters?
		|	-> Nope, it is really heavy...
		| Make supported separators? I mean supported ends of lexeme: whitespace, semicolon, parantheses, comas, etc.
		| 	-> but is it that type exactly? just make tests and maybe rewrite some stuff
